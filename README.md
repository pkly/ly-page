# Homepage RSS thing

## Built with symfony

This is just a personal project. You can use it if you'd like. Allows you to specify RSS sources, mascots, wallpapers.

RSS sources will be searched through occasionally (at most every hour, if found, items will be delayed by 15 minutes, no searches will occur once results are found for a day).

Mascots display on the page, you can select which ones you'd like using tags.

Wallpapers are a backend things that I just use to change what wallpapers display on my TV in a screensaver.
